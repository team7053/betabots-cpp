Welcome!
This is the C++ conversion of Team 7053 Robo Huskies Betabots code originally
written in Labview.

This project requires the WPILib 2019 and the Kauai Labs NavX Library for
the NavX Gyroscope.

Note that this project will not work with the upcoming 2020 version of WPILib
due to the rework of the PID system.
